description: How and why I made this blog.
---

I'm setting up a blog website in 2023.

## Why?

- Learn about making content-driven websites.
- Self publish and share instead of writing on platforms.

## How?

- Author posts in [markdown](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Markdown)
- Make templates with [liquid](https://shopify.dev/docs/api/liquid)
- [eleventy](https://11ty.dev) turns markdown + templates into HTML
- Register a domain and host on netlify free plan
