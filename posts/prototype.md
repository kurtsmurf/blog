In the 2003 song ["Prototype"](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uqhJfjbNuQg) Andre 3000 of Outkast sings:

> I hope you are the one. If not, you are the prototype.

This perfectly sums up the way I feel about everything I make while I'm making it.

For me, every project is "the one" until it runs into a brick wall or collapses under the weight of accumulated bad decisions, at which point it becomes a prototype for the next version.

I never set out to make a prototype - projects become prototypes retroactively when I decide I'm done with them.

I thought that slice was the one, but I'm beginning to think it's a prototype.
